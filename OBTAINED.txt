This is a development snapshot, and so has no tagged version.  This
is a download of commit 437b35035de4f2578eadc289700f91577a4c131c.  It
corresponds to the lib.haxe.org hxcpp version 3.2.193.

This version has been dos2unix'd.  But this is turning out to be too difficult
to maintain, so will make a subsequent checkin that simply un-dos2unix's all
of the files so that they truly have no diff with the github version.
